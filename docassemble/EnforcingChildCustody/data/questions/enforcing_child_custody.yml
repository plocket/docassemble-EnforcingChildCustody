question: |
  Enforcing a Child Custody or Parenting Plan Order
subquestion: |
  This Guided Assistant asks you questions and uses your answers to build a Personal Action Plan - a list of steps to help you with changing or enforcing child support in Alaska.
  
  Custody and Parenting Plan orders have different parts. Which parts do you want information about?  
fields:
  - "What kind of order do you need to enforce?": order_type
    datatype: checkboxes
    choices:
      - "Child support": child support
      - "Visitation schedule": visitation
      - "Another order that is not about money or your visitation schedule": other
    none of the above: false
---
id: who ordered
question: |
  Who ordered your child support?
subquestion: |
  If your children’s other parent is not paying the Child Support they were ordered to pay, you can ask CSSD or the Court for help.
fields:
  - no label: who_ordered
    input type: radio
    choices:
      - The court.: court
      - Child Support Services Division (CSSD).: cssd
  - note: |
      #### <i class="fa-regular fa-lightbulb"></i> Learn more ####
    
      <div class = 'step-subheading'>From original:</div>
        If the court ordered Child Support they probably used the 9 page Child Support Order form. Look for the form number in the lower left corner of your order. 

       <div class = 'step-subheading'>From  changing child support interview</div>
        *	Look at the top of your child support order to see if it was ordered by the Alaska Court System or Child Support Services Division.
        * Look for your name in [CourtView](https://records.courts.alaska.gov/eaccess/home.page.2), the Alaska Court System’s list of public court cases. Open up your divorce or custody case.  See if there is an entry for a “child support order
        * Contact [Child Support Services Division](https://childsupport.alaska.gov/child-support-services/contact-us) and ask them.
