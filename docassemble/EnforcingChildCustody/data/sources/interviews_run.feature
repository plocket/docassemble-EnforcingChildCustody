@interviews_start
Feature: The interviews run without erroring

This file:
[x] Test that each interview starts without an error.
[x] Contains some additional example Steps. They use fake values and are commented out with a "#" so they won't run.

These tests are made to work with the ALKiln testing framework, an automated testing framework made under the Document Assembly Line Project.

Scenario: enforcing_child_custody.yml runs
  Given I start the interview at "enforcing_child_custody.yml"
  #And the maximum seconds for each Step in this Scenario is 50
  #And I get to the question id "downloads" with this data:
  #  | var | value | trigger |
  #  | users[0].name.first | Uli | users[0].name.first |
  #  | users[0].name.last | User1 | users[0].name.first |
